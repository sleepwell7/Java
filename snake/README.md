# Overview

{My objective was to learn the java programing language along with the ide Intellij. I wanted to do this to further my understanding of object-oriented programing.}

{The software that I programmed was a basic snake game. You use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to control the snake (You can also use w,s,a,d keys as well. You move the snake around the screen to eat and cause the snake to grow. If you hit the walls or the snake hits itself it is game over.}

{My purpose is to learn and grow as a software developer and to learn to meet deadlines. The java programing languages and the Intellij IDE was learned and this software was coded over a two-week period.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Java Programing Language
Git / Git Hub
IntelliJ IDE}

{Java is an object-oriented, class based programing language. 
I used many java libraries such as File, Writer, Scanner, Graphics2D, Color, ActionEvent, ActionListener, KeyEvent, KeyListener, JFrame, Jpanel, and Timer.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I would like to implement a top ten High Score list instead of a single High Score.
* Change the snake so it looks like a snake rather than moving rectangles.
* Have the Food object slowly moving to make the snake have to work harder to catch it.
